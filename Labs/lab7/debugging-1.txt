Changes: 
 - allocated int * b dynamically

Reason:
 - in the original example, int * b was being initialized to a mem
   address that was not allowed to be accessed by the program (on flip's
   outdated version of g++, newer ones can detect and fix this...).

Use of GDB:
 - limited ;)
 - first compiled with -g flag
 - then opened in gdb
 - then set breakpoints throughout the area wihtin lines 16-18 where the segfault
   occurs.
 - when the program execution halted, did a print of the variables and a step 
   through to see that the mem addr was way out of bounds.
 - quit GBD.
